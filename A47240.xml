            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 19 -->You well know the laſt time His Majeſty's Letters Patents were ſent down, in behalf of theſe our Calamitous Neighbours, what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian reports were ſpread about the Country concerning them, which made the Charity of many grow ſtark Cold, and which carried in them two palpable Characters of the Devil that invented them: the <hi>Lyer</hi> was not onely notorious in them, but the <hi>Murtherer</hi> alſo, Inſomuch that when the <hi>poor and the needy cried for bread,</hi> the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of mankind endeavoured by this means, to withhold it from them. God give Repentance to all perſons, who did either raiſe, or propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, or credit thoſe Diabolical reports; God avert from their Souls that <hi>woe</hi> which is threatned to them who are <hi>not grieved for the affliction of Joſeph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do therefore require you, <hi>deliberately and affectionately to publiſh and declare, the tenour of His Majeſty's Letters Patents</hi> in your Pariſh, and the rather becauſe they are ſo excellently Penn'd, that the deliberate and affectionate publication of them, will furniſh all people with very proper <hi>motives and inducements</hi> to an Enlarged Charity, and will ſufficiently confute all thoſe Murtherous lies, which have been forg'd in Hell to obſtruct it. For you will ſee that the perſons commended to our tender regard, are <hi>French,</hi> who have here <hi>taken Refuge,</hi> and in that reſpect are <hi>ſtrangers in the land,</hi> and they are <hi>Proteſtants</hi> too, ſuch who profeſs the ſame Belief with us; you will ſee that they are <hi>diſtreſſed, and reduced to extream wants, both they and their Families, that their Condition is deplorable, that a great many are ſtill under preſſing neceſſities, that ſince the laſt Collection, Great numbers have, and do ſtill daily come over, that the publick ſtock collected by the laſt Brief has been faithfully expended, and that ſtock now failing, without farther ſupplies they muſt inevitably periſh;</hi> and what ſhall now be contributed, we have all the Reaſon in the world to be aſſured, ſhall be as faithfully expended as the former, and that too <hi>without any diſtinction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon theſe and the like conſiderations, I require you, <hi>earneſtly to perſuade, exhort and ſtir up the people committed to your care, to contribute freely and chearfully towards the Relief of theſe diſtreſſed Chriſtians,</hi> and I beſeech you to enforce your exhortations with your own Example, and as far as your Condition permits to

               <!-- PDF PAGE 19 -->
give very liberal Alms your ſelf. We are enjoyned by God <hi>to doe good to all men, eſpecially to thoſe who are of the Houſehold of Faith,</hi> and when we ſee ſuch great numbers of our Brethren, in ſo very great want, Charity obliges all Chriſtians to be fervent in their Prayers for them, and not onely to pray for them, but according to their abilities to be <hi>bountifull</hi> towards them.</p>
            <p>This is a duty which frequently occurs in holy Scripture: our Tranſlation calls it <hi>Hoſpitality;</hi> but the Original ſignifies <hi>love to Strangers:</hi> the Primitive Chriſtians were moſt Exemplary in this kind of Charity, and the Apoſtle urges this powerfull argument to encourage us to it. <hi>Be not forgetfull to entertain Strangers: for thereby ſome have Entertained Angels unawares. Remember them that are in bonds as bound with them: and them which ſuffer adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity as being your ſelves alſo in the body.</hi> It is a great honour to have <hi>Angels,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> had, for our Gueſts. But our Saviour offers us a greater, which is to Entertain diſtreſſed Chriſtian <hi>Strangers,</hi> whom he calls His <hi>Brethren.</hi> For in taking ſuch <hi>Strangers</hi> into our houſes, we take in our Saviour himſelf, who is <hi>God bleſſed for ever:</hi> ſo that were I put to my Choice, I had much rather Entertain the <hi>Stranger</hi> than the <hi>Angel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God of his Infinite mercy open all our bowels towards theſe diſtreſſed <hi>Strangers,</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> of Chriſt, that in the great day of ſeparation Chriſt may <hi>ſet us at His right hand,</hi> and ſay thoſe tranſporting words to us, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World, for I was a ſtranger and ye took me in.</hi>
